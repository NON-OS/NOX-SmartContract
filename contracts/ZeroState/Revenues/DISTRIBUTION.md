## ðŸ”¹ Boost Model

Each NFT holder received a base share of the monthly distribution proportional to their number of NFTs held.  
To reward larger contributors and encourage stronger participation, multipliers were applied:

- **1 NFT:** Base allocation (1.00Ã—)  
- **2 NFTs:** +10% boost (1.10Ã—)  
- **3+ NFTs:** +20% boost (1.20Ã—)

The boosted weights were normalized so the total remained **exactly 3,250,000 NOX**.

## ðŸ”¹ Genesis Allocation Note

This payment was executed from the Genesis 1.5% token allocation.  
The Genesis pool was created for long-term ecosystem rewards and NFT utility benefits.  
NFT sales contributed to strengthening the liquidity pool by **+10 ETH** so far, directly enhancing stability for token holders.

Future distributions will be automated via smart contract, replacing the current manual process starting next month.
