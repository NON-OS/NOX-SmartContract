### 💎 Community Boost Edition

This month’s payout was **doubled** as a thank-you to everyone supporting NOX through the latest phase of growth.  
The project has seen strong expansion in liquidity, NFT adoption, and active community engagement — so the team decided to match the monthly 3.25M NOX reward with an additional **bonus 3.25M**, bringing the total to **6.5M NOX** for October.

Each holder received exactly **2× their base allocation**, ensuring fairness across allocations.

---

### 🌐 Verification

Both transactions are publicly verifiable on Etherscan.  
The same 70 addresses from the verified NFT holder snapshot were used in both transfers, maintaining transparency and fairness.

### ❤️ Thank You

The NOX team extends its gratitude to the entire community — your trust, feedback, and consistent participation are what keep the project thriving.  
This “double share” distribution celebrates that success and recognizes the holders helping to build long-term value.

**Next distribution:** November 2025 — automated via the new smart contract.
